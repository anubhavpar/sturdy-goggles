## Problem Statement
- Our team has collaborated with WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) to explore and seek recommendations on optimizing deployment of their street team to collect email addresses of potential attendees for their upcoming gala event.
- The gala is set to happen in June 2019, so we chose to analyze a 4 week period of data from 4/28/2019 - 5/24/2019 (we chose not to analyze data from 2020 because we wanted to avoid effects from the COVID-19 pandemic)
- Our team used turnstile data fron New York City subway stations (MTA) in combination with NYC demographic data from the census to find where we should allocate resources to gathering email addresses.
- The project findings were compiled in a Powerpoint Presentation for the client.

## Data Sources
- http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html (MTA subway station data)
- https://www.kaggle.com/muonneutrino/new-york-city-census-data?select=nyc_census_tracts.csv (New York City census data)

## Methodology
- Get the MTA and demographic datasets
- Decide time frame for exploratory data analysis
- Data cleaning
- Cross reference demographic data with census data
- Analyze factors correlated with our project goals (e.g. income, profession)
- Create data visualizations
- Presentation preparations

## Findings
- We found the MTA stations with the most traffic over our 4 week period
- The data was aggregated to find the average weekly activity based on time and weekday
